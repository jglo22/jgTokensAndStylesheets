  <div class="introduction">
    <p>I bring 20+ years’ experience across product, design, and delivery,
      with deep experience in healthcare and life sciences.</p>
    <p>I’m strong at balancing evolving requirements, decision-making, and
      execution, with a focus on measurable outcomes.</p>
    <p>I operate at the crossover between subject matter experts, software
      engineers, and users, translating messy real-world user journeys into
      coherent, scalable products.</p>
    <p>My work typically involves a combination of:</p>
    <p>Product Management UX and UI Design Service Design User Research
      Digital Strategy Content Design &amp; Information Architecture</p>
    <p>This expertise means I’m highly effective at defining, delivering,
      and evolving products that meet real user needs and achieve business
      goals.</p>

      <p>I led product definition for Chemist, a scientific platform used
        internally to support AI-assisted reasoning, decision-making, and
        experimental planning.</p>
      <p>The work focused on two complementary strands of work:</p>
      <p>Firstly, designing interfaces to keep humans-in-the-loop for
        specialist tools, allowing medicinal chemists to interrogate and guide
        complex AI outputs and scientific data.</p>
      <p>Secondly, stitching multiple tools into a coherent workflow that
        enabled seamless movement from hypothesis exploration through to
        experimental planning.</p>
      <h4 id="key-achievements">Key achievements</h4>
      <ul>

        <li>Increased findability and UX for expert users by re-architecting
          information structures and navigation surfaces.</li>
