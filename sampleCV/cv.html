  <h1>Product &amp; Platform Leader</h1>

  <h2>I lead the design of complex digital platforms and products, often in situations where the problem is unclear and the constraints are real.</h2>

  <h3>I bring 20+ years' experience across product, design, and delivery, with deep experience in healthcare and life sciences.</h3>

  <p>I'm strong at balancing evolving requirements, decision-making, and execution, with a focus on measurable outcomes.</p>

  <p>I operate at the crossover between subject matter experts, software engineers, and users, translating messy real-world user journeys into coherent, scalable products.</p>

  <p>My work typically involves a combination of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Product Management</li>
    <li>UX and UI Design</li>
    <li>Service Design</li>
    <li>User Research</li>
    <li>Digital Strategy</li>
    <li>Content Design &amp; Information Architecture</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This expertise means I'm highly effective at defining, delivering, and evolving products that meet real user needs and achieve business goals.</p>
